# Kinect_Cow_Body_Condition_Scanner
An application for using a kinect v2 to capture depth images of dairy cows to monitor body condition.

This project is aimed at robotic milking stations, however feed stations or other locations in the barn can also be used. A prerequisite is that an external source can trigger this software to capture an image, while also delivering the cow identity. For the Delaval V300 AMS I wrote a webgui client that can retrieve cow identities all without aditional hardware. This can be found in my other repository.
